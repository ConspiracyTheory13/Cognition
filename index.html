We make decisions and judgments every day. If we were to carefully consider and analyze
every possible outcome of every decision and judgment, we would never get anything done!
Thankfully our brain makes this easier for us by using cognitive shortcuts.
A heuristic is a mental shortcut that helps us make decisions quickly.
Usually these short cuts are helpful in keeping us from becoming overloaded, however there
are some pitfalls to these short cuts! Start the quiz to learn about some of the ways that
our brains commonly help us!
